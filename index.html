    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>A key structure was a bucket that only poured water out when it got to a certain level, I think it could be in the real black box because when we poured water in it reacted the same way the real black box does.

</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The black box is a box that collects water through one end and pours it out through the other end but it dosent always pour out the same amount. My initial observation about the box was water only came out when you poured in a lot of water. </p>
    <h1>Reasoning,Part 1</h1>
    <p>A model is a smaller scale of something someone is trying to represent. Models can be helpful when try to explain how something works.

</p>
<h1>Reasoning, Part 2</h1>
<p>I think that water only comes out when water gets to a certain point because whenvwe did a trial on our model of the black box it reacted the same way the real black box does</p>
<h1>Reasoning, Part 3</h1>
<p>If there wasnt a bucket that poured water out when it got to a certain point then the same amount of water poured in would come out </p>
